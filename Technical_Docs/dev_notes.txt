Old Database Workflow Logic:

When CEA approval is completed:
1. NotifyCEAAdministrativeUsers() => this method is used to send notification to the CEA Administrators to upload the request to JDE. It uses the following stored procedure to get the members of "CEAUPLOADR" distrubution group:
	Old: Projectuser.spGetCEAAdministratorEmailList
	New: Projectuser.Pr_GetCEAAdministratorEmailList
2. NotifyCostCenterUsers() => this method is used to send notification to the Cost Center approvers about the completion of approval process. It uses the following stored procedures.
	Old: Projectuser.spGetCostCenterEmailList
	New: Projectuser.Pr_GetCostCenterEmailList 
3. NotifyEquipmentNoAssigners() => this method is used to send notification to the Equipment Administrators (Dist. Group Code: EQUIPADMIN) to assign equipment number to the CEA. It uses the following stored procedures:
	Old: Projectuser.spGetEquipmentNoAssigners
	New: Projectuser.Pr_GetEquipmentNoAssigners 

4. Reassigning to other approver
	Old: Projectuser.spReassignToApprover
